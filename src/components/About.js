                After 8 years working at a non-profit with teenagers, I made the courageous decision to switch careers, learn something new, and transition into web development. I have always enjoyed using my creativity and problem-solving skills, and both of those skill sets have translated well in this new pathway. I'm excited to start a new career as a front-end developer. As I continue my professional journey, I like to think of my career as one big learning experience that continuously grows with each project and collaboration. With a dedication to functionality and a curiosity for whatâ€™s ahead of the curve, I keep my work practical, relevant and creative. Have a look at my past projects, and feel free to reach out with any questions.
